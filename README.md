An MLOps project for food classification using computer vision techniques.

## ðŸ¤– Models

### Model Evaluation

Evaluate the available models by running the evaluation script:

```bash
uv run src/eval/eval.py
```

This command evaluates three distinct models using MLflow tracking:

#### 1. **Food-101-93M** (Benchmark Model)
- **Source**: [HuggingFace Model](https://huggingface.co/prithivMLmods/Food-101-93M)
- **Performance**: ~90% accuracy on Food-101 dataset
- **Purpose**: Pre-trained benchmark model and potential deployment candidate

#### 2. **ResNet-18** (Base Model)
- **Source**: [Microsoft ResNet-18](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/resnet-18)
- **Training**: Pre-trained on ImageNet-1k dataset
- **Purpose**: Base model for fine-tuning on Food-101 dataset

#### 3. **VGG-16** (Alternative Base Model)
- **Source**: [PyTorch VGG-16](https://docs.pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.vgg16.html)
- **Training**: Pre-trained on ImageNet-1k dataset
- **Purpose**: Alternative base model for Food-101 fine-tuning

#### Viewing Results

Launch the MLflow UI to inspect evaluation results:

```bash
uv run mlflow ui
```

Then navigate to the displayed URL (typically [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)) to view the interactive dashboard.

### Adding New Models
- To add new models you can create a new class with the name of the model under `src/models`.
- To make existing scripts and code work with the model make sure that it inherits from [this abstract base model class](src/models/food_classification_model.py), requiring the model class to have a classify function that takes in an image as bytes and returns an integer indicating the id of the label.
- Examples can be found in the `src/models` directory.
